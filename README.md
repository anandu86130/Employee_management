## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Go**: Version 1.18 or higher. You can download and install Go from [here](https://golang.org/dl/).
- **PostgreSQL**: For storing employee records. [Download PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and set it up.
- **Redis** (optional): For caching. You can [download Redis](https://redis.io/download) if you wish to use this feature.

### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the repository**:
   First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-management.git


---

### Key Points:
- **Dependencies**: The `go mod tidy` command ensures that Go dependencies are correctly installed.
- **Database Setup**: Steps for setting up PostgreSQL are outlined (including creating a database and updating the `.env` file).
- **Redis**: An optional section is included for setting up Redis caching if needed.
  
This should cover the installation process more thoroughly for new developers setting up the project.
